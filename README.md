SBOM & Grype DevSecOps Lab

Overview
This lab demonstrates a complete DevSecOps workflow for securing a Python application using Docker, Grype, and SBOMs. It covers the full lifecycle from repository creation to vulnerability detection, remediation, and final validation.

The main objective is to show how automated security scanning integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, while allowing teams to interpret results and remediate vulnerabilities efficiently.

Features
- Creation of a new GitHub repository
- Python application (app.py) containerized with Docker
- Dependency management via requirements.txt
- Vulnerability scanning with Grype
- Generation of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Report generation in TXT and JSON formats
- Detection, reporting, and remediation of critical vulnerabilities
- Rescan after fixes to confirm the pipeline turns green

Lab Steps
1. Repository Setup  
   Initialize a new GitHub repository and validate project structure.

2. Application Development  
   Create app.py (sample Python application) and define dependencies in requirements.txt.

3. Containerization  
   Write Dockerfile for the Python app (initially uses a vulnerable base image for teaching purposes).

4. Pipeline Setup  
   Create GitHub Actions workflow (grype-scan.yml) that runs Grype automatically on each push.

5. Initial Scan  
   First scan detects one or more critical vulnerabilities.

6. Interpretation & Reporting  
   Analyze the TXT report (manually or with ChatGPT) and share a clear summary with supervisors.

7. Vulnerability Remediation  
   Update Dockerfile (e.g., upgrade base image or pin secure versions) to eliminate critical vulnerabilities.

8. Rescan & Validation  
   New scan shows “No vulnerabilities found” and pipeline status becomes green.

Repository Structure
.github/workflows/grype-scan.yml     # CI/CD pipeline
app.py                               # Sample Python application
requirements.txt                     # Python dependencies
Dockerfile                           # Container definition
grype-report.json                    # Generated by pipeline
grype-report.txt                     # Generated by pipeline

Technologies & Tools
- Python – Application development
- Docker – Containerization
- Grype – Vulnerability scanner
- Syft – SBOM generation (used internally by Grype)
- GitHub Actions – CI/CD automation
- ChatGPT (optional) – Report summarization

How to Run Locally
1. Build the image
   docker build --no-cache -t sbom-lab .

2. Scan with Grype
   grype sbom-lab -o table > grype-report.txt
   grype sbom-lab -o json > grype-report.json

3. View results
   cat grype-report.txt

Learning Outcomes
- Master software supply chain security and SBOM concepts
- Integrate automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Detect, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities quickly
- Produce clear technical and managerial reports
- Apply real-world DevSecOps best practices

Why This Lab is Valuable for Recruiters
- Proves hands-on security experience in a complete CI/CD environment
- Shows ability to automate detection and remediation of vulnerabilities
- Demonstrates clear communication of technical results
- Confirms proficiency with industry-standard tools (Docker, Grype, GitHub Actions, SBOM)
